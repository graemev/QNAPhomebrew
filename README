19Oct2023: Graeme Vetterlein. Scripts to allow TS412 to run as a NAS [ :-) ] using minimum (electrical) power.
So try to spin the disks down, stop the fan, slow the CPU to lowest speed etc.

This makes extensive use of "labels" (filesystem and swap). We assume the (4) trays of the QNAP
hold different sized disks and there is an external SSD, which is the normal "boot system".

So for example Tray1 might hold:

Label  Typical Mount

boot1  /boot
root1  /
var1   /var
swap1  Used as swap (swapon(8))
tmp1   /tmp
home1  /home
data1  TBD
rest1  TBD

The scripts:


 QNAPmount.sh				- Enable the various filesystem so they get shared
 grab-all-mdt-with-saboteur.sh		- Needed to make a PiXe backup image of the FLASH (iff we are running a SABOTER layout)
 grab-all-mdt-with-mouiche.sh		- Needed to make a PiXe backup image of the FLASH (iff we are running a MOUICHE layout)
 grab-all-mdt-with-QTS.sh		- Needed to make a PiXe backup image of the FLASH (iff we are running original QTS)


 QNAP_commision_disk.sh			- Completely reformat a drive to use it with Homebrew (needs to be "blanked" first)
 QNAP_config_disk.sh			- Set the HDPARMS etc so the drives use minimum power (or not if you so choose)
 QNAP_create_raid.sh			- creates /dev/md0 using all (e.g. data) partitions
 QNAP_clone_disk.sh			- Takes the "current" system (not DATA) and clones it to another drive
 QNAP_clone_alldisk.sh			- Calls QNAP_clone_disk.sh to clone to all the "other" drives
 Makefile				- Builds the commands
 choose-root				- copy to /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/choose-root to enable multiboot
