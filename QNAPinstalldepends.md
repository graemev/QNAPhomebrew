**QNAP_installdepends** â€” Installs packages needed by QNAPHomebrew (uninstall others)

SYNOPSIS
========

| **QNAP_installdepends** 

DESCRIPTION
===========

Check this script and amend as needed. Note it removes "java(1)" and "plymouth(8)" both
of which cause problems on the QNAP.

- Java simply coredumps (run java -verision)  which breaks some certificates.
- plymouth can't be used on a TS412 (since it lacks a display) but hugely
  increases initrd(4) size.
