This is the first version of the "C" version of QNAP_manage_disks disks. It is
designed to be a like for like replacement for the bash shell script version.
It should produce better logging. Its main USP however is does not invoke (many)
other programs, which the shell version obviously does. This should help avoid
waiting any sleeping disks to search for binary programs.

It includes a shared object "libhdparm.so" which is taken basically unchanged
from the hdparm package and made into a shared library.
